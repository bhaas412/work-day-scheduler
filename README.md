# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This project is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events per hour of the day (9AM-5PM). Starter code was given and expanded upon using Bootstrap, jQuery, and the Moment.js library to work with date/time. Event descriptions are saved in local storage and loaded upon page refresh/return. Timeblocks are also coded depending on the current time (gray timeblocks are past times, red timeblock is present time, and green timeblocks are future times).
